# Life Changing Labs website

Designed and built by Samson Zhang in September-October 2020.

## Development

Clone the repo and run `npm run dev` to start a dev server at `localhost:3000`.

Run `npx run netlify-cms-proxy-server` to make Netlify CMS accessible locally at `localhost:3000/admin/index.html`. Changes you make in the local CMS interface will be saved as file changes.
