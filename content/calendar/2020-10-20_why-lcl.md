LCL serves as one of the hubs for entrepreneurship, as we provide resources and opportunities for business development and networking. We plan and host school-wide, monthly and annual entrepreneurship events. Over the summer we run an incubator program to help companies expand and build their startups and products. In addition, we bring in influential guest speakers and mentors to inspire and motivate student entrepreneurs.
