I know that COVID-19 made it difficult for really any summer program to go on, so it meant a lot to me that LCL \"hung in there\" and held its accelerator program anyway. Your persistence is really admirable, and it was amazing that you all managed to foster such a warm, caring environment, even though we were communicating through screens. I definitely learned a lot, but what really stuck with me the whole time is how welcoming everyone was. I was worried initially that I'd stick out too much and be isolated or left behind, but everyone was so kind and friendly that I truly felt at home. I wish you all the best, and I hope you stay happy and healthy in these trying times.” - Mei Johnson, LCL ‘20"

    {
      "question": "What is Pitch Practice and why is it important?",
      "answer": "The impact of your idea is only as strong as your ability to communicate it. Pitch Practice is a weekly session for rehearsing your pitch to other founders and (schedule-permitting) our Guest Judges. \n\nFurthermore, rehearsing your pitch can be one of the best ways to clarify and refine your ideas. \n\nOur most successful LCL alums have been those who have taken pitch practice seriously. \n\n“There are many interesting & smart ideas, but if you cannot pitch them, they will never happen.” - Vini Tripathii, LCL Class of 2019 & Recipient of Cornell Tech Startup Award"
