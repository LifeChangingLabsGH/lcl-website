      "content": "Each year, we select top founders for an 8-week boot camp, where we give them the skills, resources, and community they will need to accelerate their startups to match their vision.\n\nEach summer culminates with a Demo Day, where the startups present their companies to a select panel of judges â€” venture capitalists, angel investors, and prominent entrepreneurs.\n\nDemo Day is just the beginning of a lifetime membership with LCL. Accelerator graduates get an automatic invite to join Life Changing Network and lifetime access to StartupTree platform."
