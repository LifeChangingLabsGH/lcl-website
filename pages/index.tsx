                    Each summer culminates with a Demo Day, where the startups present their companies to a select panel of judges â€” venture capitalists, angel investors, and prominent entrepreneurs.

                        Demo Day is just the beginning of a lifetime membership with LCL. Accelerator graduates get an automatic invite to join Life Changing Network and lifetime access to StartupTree platform.
